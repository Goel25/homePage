            <p class="descBox">I first gained interest in programming when I was into Minecraft. I bought a Minecraft
              server and programmed in a custom scripting language called Skript, which was a lot like Python.
              Eventually I decided to learn Java, because that is what Minecraft is written in. Over that summer I
              watched TheNewBostons Java tutorials, and learned basic Java. I stopped programming for a couple of
              months, since I didn't know how to make very interesting programs yet. I then found The Coding Train's
              (Daniel Shiffman) p5.js tutorials, and proceeded to binge watch the entire series in a couple of weeks.
              Daniel Shiffman's love for programming was infectious, and I was now able to create much more intersting,
              visual games. After doing javascript for a while, I decided to go back to Java, but this time I used the
              procesing library, which is the Java version of p5.js. My parents later suprised me that spring break by
              taking me to New York to meet Daniel, which was an absolutely incredible experience, to put it lightly. I
              wanted to make more complex games, with an actual game engine, so I watched Brackey's tutorials to learn
              C#, along with Unity. I participated in multiple game jams on itch.io, which were all awesome
              experiences. I went back to Javascript, and created a Genetic Algorithm, and eventually a Neural Network,
              which I would translate into Java to teach my computer to play flappy bird. I've now started learning
              python, as it is one of the most powerful languages for Machine Learning, and I hope to make some image
              classifiers.</p>

          <p class="descBox">This is a combination of a neural network and genetic algorithm to beat flappy bird.
            This was made in a few days at a programming camp. I copied the NN and GA from my other Javascript
            projects, and translated them into Java. Overall it does pretty well, although other Flappy Bird AI'
      s can do much better. I'm not completely sure why they are (perhaps they use a much better NN, like tensorflow).
      This is my overall favorite project as it is the most impressive and combines all of my (Java) knowledge into a
      single project.</p> <div class="infoBox">
