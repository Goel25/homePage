You move towards your mouse, and click to shoot. There are turrets that shoot at you, but there is no collision detection so nothing happens when you or the turrets get hit. Althuough it isn't really playable and broken, I was able to reuse a lot of the code for other projects, and it was a good learning expierience.",
